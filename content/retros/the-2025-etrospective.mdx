## Introduction

2025 is here, and it's a year of transformation ðŸ’ª

My goal this year is to improve my physical health, hitting the gym at least 3 times a week. Alongside that, I'll dive into new technologies and build my personal brand by launching a website to share my experiences, knowledge, and blog posts.
