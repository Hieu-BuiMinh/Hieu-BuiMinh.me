## Introduction

We're at the end of the year! Happy New Year 2025!

This year has been huge for me; it's my first year of working full-time. I had a lot of new experiences. Here's how it went!

## Bought a MacBook with my own money

Believe it or not, this is my first MacBook bought with my own money. I got my last one for free from Apple Academy ðŸ¤£.

Though I can't say it isn't expensive, I feel this purchase is well justified since it has brought me thousands of percent in returns as it supports my work.

This one is a 14" MacBook Pro M3 Pro, with 36GB RAM and 1TB storage. You can never go wrong with more RAM; I don't regret spending extra hundreds for just the extra RAM. I don't want to see the 'out of application memory' popup ðŸ’€
