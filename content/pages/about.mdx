I am a 25-year-old Software Engineer from Vietnam, born in 2000. I specialize in the React ecosystem and have experience working with TypeScript, Next.js, React.js, Node.js, and database management. Currently, I am passionate about learning UI/UX design.

I started learning web development on December 5, 2020 (I was 20 years old). It's a big challenge because it's just one of my hobbies, and I have yet to take any courses. I am self-learning on YouTube. Some of my favorite YouTube channels are [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja), [Code With Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio), [Cosden Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@cosdensolutions). I learned a lot of web development skills from them.

I love using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to create a website. Then use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host my codebase. After that, I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy it.

The advice and motivation I've found from `Jim Rohn` have been a big help in keeping me focused and pushing forward, even when things get tough üí™.

Thanks to **Timothy Lin** for the
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It helped me when I haven't any idea how to create a blog from scratch. My code isn't like the starter code because I changed a lot of code :)
