## Kinh dịch là gì!?

Recently, I've gathered a collection of exceptional websites in UI/UX design that left me in awe upon my initial exploration. I believe these websites can greatly enrich your UI skills. Here's a list of my top 8 favorite websites (in no particular order).

## Raycast

Raycast is a productivity tool that enables fast task completion. Its homepage captivated me with its UI design, featuring my favorite gradient colors and various shades of red (the theme color).

Scrolling down showcases its unique features, clearly demonstrating its product capabilities. This led me to promptly download the software after purchasing a [MacBook Air 15"](/uses). The effort put into image creation, UI design, and color selection by their developers is evident on the website and is worth learning from.
